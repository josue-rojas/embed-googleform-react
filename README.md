# embed-googleform-react

## About

We also get the features with google forms, like the ability to get notifications and have google sheet for the entries. The page itself is a simple sign up form.

Uses
- React
- Sass
- Github Page (for deployment)
- Google Forms

### Notes:
This was a rushed project (cause I was bored and decided in the last minute to do it), so that means there is a lot of messy code. If you have a question about it feel free to ask. (cause I sure will have questions)

Also this was inspired by something I saw long ago on how to customize a embed google form. Here is a similar link to what I saw long ago: https://blog.webjeda.com/google-form-customize/ (this just might it though, i don't really remember)
